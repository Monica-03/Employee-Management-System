# Employee-Management-System
A Java program to implement "Employee Management System" using Object Oriented Programming Concepts.<br>
In this code I have used the concept of Classes and Objects to solve the problem. I have created a menu for the user which consists of 5 different features:<br>

1.To add an employee<br> 
2.To view details of an employee<br>
3.To remove an employee<br> 
4.To update info of an employee<br> 
5.To exit the Portal.<br>

For each of these features I have created a separate class to maintain the decorum of the code. Also I have use the concept of Switch Cases to automate the task and make it more useful and user friendly. User need to just enter the numbers as per given and it will perform the task<br>

For Compliation : <code>javac Main.java</code><br>
To Run Program : <code>java Main</code>
